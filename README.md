##### Web server for all differential expression (DE) callers

</div>

## About
`shinyDE` is an R Shiny web server for all differential expression (DE) callers.  Currently, `shinyDE` supports edgeR, DESeq2, baySeq, NOISeq, SAMSeq, DEGseq, EBSeq, and PoissonSeq.  Users can run multiple DE callers in parallel and observe mutual overlaps of statistical results called in common between, e.g., edgeR and DESeq2, which can then further be sorted by p-value, FDR, etc.  `shinyDE` also supports heatmaps, gene ontology analyses, and Venn diagrams.

Note: this package is alpha stage, expect (lots of) bugs and changes.
